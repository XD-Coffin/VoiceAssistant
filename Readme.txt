This is a voice assistant coded by me. But it's made for my
 convinience so might not work properly for you

-You can learn watching the code and making it work for you properly for you
Some the options set for convinience are:

1. If you ask about anything and your phrase contains wikipedia it will search from wikipedia and 
   speak the results for you eg: Sahil Singh 'wikipedia' or who is Sahil Singh according to 'wikipedia'.
2. open commands for web searches such as open youtube, open google e.t.c.
3. Note if you mention 'bad' in the phrase assistant will open porn.
4. You can ask simple Qns such as "Who are you" , "who do you belong to", "thank you"
5. "shut down please" shuts the program.
6.  speaking "notepad" will open notepad.
7. You can do advanced searches by "search in youtube"
8. "pc sleep", "pc shutdown", "text modes are also availiable"

THE BEST PRACTICE WILL BE TO LOOK THE CODE AND FINISH CODE FOR YOUR CONVINIENCE.
